Project 2 - IMT2581 Rapid Prototyping at NTNU Gjøvik

This is a 48 hour project (Friday 30. October 2020 18:00 - Sunday 01. November 2020 18:00) with theme from Weekly Game Jam 173 (http://www.weeklygamejam.com/) as a submission for my project #2 in the course IMT2581 Rapid Prototyping at NTNU Gjøvik. The theme for this jam was "Secret Door".

The game is made entirely with PyGame and can be run by running the main.py file in Python.

You play as a young man who can shoot bullets to kill the enemies. The goal is to reveal each stage's secret door so you can proceed to the next stage. To reveal the secret door you must kill all enemies on the stage. Each time you progress to the next stage you get 1hp back.

Every stage contains more enemies as you proceed, and the enemies will be able to move faster. 
Every fifth stage will increase the maximum ammunition by 3. 

You get +10 score for reaching a new stage and +5 score for killing an enemy.

Controls:
Arrow keys - move player
Space bar - Shoot
Return key - Enter door
